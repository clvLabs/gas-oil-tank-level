### Requirements

This project has been developed with PlatformIO, you can compile it with the stock Arduino IDE, but you'll have a nicer time with PlatformIO...

### Configuration

At this stage in the project, you have to edit `src/config.h` to set the configuration. In a future time configuration will be moved to EEPROM and some UI will be created to allow the user to configure the most important settings.
